# Moving Files to WSL Guide

In this file I will cover a step by step guide on how I created the server folder for this little project.

## Server.zip creation
1. Create a folder on your desktop.
2. Download the PaperMC server application from https://papermc.io/ , the .jar file.
3. Download the JVM files from https://docs.papermc.io/paper/aikars-flags/ . For our application should be a .sh file because we will run this script in a Linux env, for a Windows env would've been .bat file.
4. Place the both files in the same folder and right click on the folder and under the Compress to drop down menu you should find ZIP format.
5. That's it for now we created the folder for our server.

In this section I will explain what steps to follow to achieve a file transfer between WSL and Windows folders. This will cover many immportant command lines for the file management system in Linux.
