# Minecraft Server in WSL
For the sake of learning new things I thought how it will be to run a Minecraft server on my Raspberry Pi to play with my friends and in this way I can also showcase my Linux CLI understanding that I have gained so far. Running a Minecraft server on a Raspberry Pi it is not the best ideal becasue of the low specification that a raspberry pi has, but in the end is a great project to learn Linux CLI basic commands.
